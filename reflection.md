To complete this project, I first cloned an empty GitHub repository and created a branch called feature/header using git checkout -b feature/header. On this branch, I created an index.html file and added <header> section with an <h1> inside the body. I staged and commited the file using git add and git commit.
Since the repository was empty, Icreated a main branch with git switch -c main. From there, I created another branch called feature/footer and added a <footer> section to the index.html file. I staged and commited those changes and then returned to feature/header, where I added a different footer to create a merge conflict.
After switching back to main, I merged feature/footer first and then merged feature/header. A merge conflict occured because both branches modified the same line of code. I resolved the conflict by removing the incoming change and keepimg the current.After the merge I moved the footer inside the <body> element to mantain clean and proper HTML structure.
